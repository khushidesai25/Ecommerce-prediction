📌 Project Description: E-commerce Customer Spending Prediction

This project analyzes customer behavior from an E-commerce dataset to predict how much customers are likely to spend annually. The main goal is to identify key factors that influence yearly spending and build a predictive model that businesses can use for marketing strategies, personalized offers, and customer retention.

🔍 Objectives

Explore the dataset to understand customer attributes (e.g., time on website, time on app, length of membership).

Perform data visualization (histograms, boxplots, jointplots, heatmaps) to identify patterns and correlations.

Build a Linear Regression model to predict the Yearly Amount Spent by customers.

Evaluate the model’s performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RMSE.

Analyze residuals to check the accuracy and reliability of predictions.

🛠️ Methodology

Data Preprocessing – Loaded the dataset, checked for duplicates, and explored data types.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualized relationships between customer behavior (time on app, website usage, membership duration) and spending.

Feature Selection – Chose relevant features such as Time on Website, Time on App, and Length of Membership.

Model Training –

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Trained a Linear Regression model using Scikit-learn.

Evaluation – Compared predicted vs. actual values using scatter plots and error metrics.

📊 Results & Insights

Length of Membership was the strongest predictor of yearly spending.

App usage showed a stronger relationship with spending compared to website usage.

The Linear Regression model provided a good fit with low error values, making it useful for business decision-making.

🚀 Applications

Customer lifetime value prediction.

Personalized marketing campaigns.

Sales forecasting for future business planning.
